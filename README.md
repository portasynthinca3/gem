# Generic ESP32 8086 eMulator
I started this project 3 years and never got around to finishing it. It was
supposed to emulate the rest of the IBM PC, not just the CPU.

## Building
  1. Install ESP-IDF
  2. Clone the repo with the submodules\
     `git clone --recursive https://github.com/portasynthinca3/gem.git`
  3. Run IDF: `idf.py build flash monitor`
